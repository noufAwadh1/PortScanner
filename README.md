# PortScanner
This tool is used for scanning ports 
## How does it work?
+ This tool uses the  socket library in Python to send a request through a  specific port to check if this port is open or not 
+ This is achieved by `socket.connect_ex(address)`, which returns 0 if the connection succeeds. 

## How to use it?
+ Enter the hostname that you need to scan
+ Enter the ports numbers that you need to check
